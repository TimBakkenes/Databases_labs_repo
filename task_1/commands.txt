For a student to graduate there are a number of requirements they must 
first fulfill. They must have passed (have at least grade 3) in all mandatory 
courses of the educational program they belong to, as well as the mandatory 
courses of the particular branch that they must have chosen. 
Also they must have passed at least 10 credits worth of courses among the recommended 
courses for the branch. Furthermore they need to have read and passed (at least) 20 credits 
worth of courses classified as mathematical courses, and at least one seminar course. 
Mandatory and recommended courses that are also classified in some way are counted just like 
any other course, so if one of the mandatory courses of a program is also a seminar course, students 
of that program will not be required to read any additional seminar courses.
